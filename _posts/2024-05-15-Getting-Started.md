## Where I Am Now

After a semester in HTML/CSS, Python, and Java (all very basic but necessary), I have begun working on learning as much as I can about how things work together(more heavily in Java). I have grown more proficient in working with objects, and have written a basic serializing program that creates an object and serializes it's attributes to a CSV file and back out. While doing this I have been introduced into the gradle file structure, though I dont fully understand it, and have become much more proficient in GIT.

### Things I Have learned most recently:

1) a method that is specific to an obj shall always be in the obj. If you need to call the method from main, declare the method using public static var name(){} this will allow you to import the method from the object and use it in main.
2) When using an interface, it is best practice to program to the interface by creating objects as follows: InterfaceName nameOfObj = new obj(); this will allow more flexibility for when I get into things i don't yet understand.
3) compareTo() is a crutial function that allows you to create organized lists/sets(no duplicates) by comparing objects attributes (using compareToIgnoreCase() on strings) to provide a 0 for the same thing, -number for something before( alphabetically) and a positive number for something after. Use interface comparable.
4) Serializable is an empty interface that marks the class created as something that contains a serializing method.

There is much more but these are some of the bigger things that I have learned over the past two weeks. 
Stand by for more to come.
