## Where this started.

Dr. Bowring, a professor at College of Charleston  and the man behind the curtain of CIRDLES.org, reccomended that I maintain a Git blog of my progress in programing. Given the vast amount of information I am accumulating daily and some of the more off the wall projects I have been working on, it does seem like a fantastic idea to document my progress so that I can reference the information i need from my own voice and understanding. So here I am. Lets press on!
